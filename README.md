SisyphosDBX
Open-source Dropbox client for macOS and Linux

---

---
SisyphosDBX is an open-source Dropbox client written in Python. Project's main goal is to provide an open-source desktop Dropbox client for platforms that aren't supported. SisyphosDBX is script-based which makes it platform-independent. It's written using the Python SDK for Dropbox API v2.

	SisyphosDBX doesn't have production status yet, so only 100 accounts can use my API keys.
