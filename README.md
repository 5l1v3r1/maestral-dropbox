# SisyphosDBX
Open-source Dropbox client for macOS and Linux

## About
SisyphosDBX is an open-source Dropbox client written in Python. Project's main goal is to provide an open-source desktop Dropbox client for platforms that aren't supported. SisyphosDBX is script-based which makes it platform-independent. It's written using the Python SDK for Dropbox API v2.

*IMPORTANT:*
SisyphosDBX doesn't have production status yet, so only 500 accounts can use the API keys.

## Installation
Download and install the package by running
```console
$ pip git+https://github.com/SamSchott/sisyphosdbx
```
in the command line.
